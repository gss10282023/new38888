# v1.0.0 — Initial open-source release

BIOTech Futures Hub is a full-stack collaboration platform for project-based programs: passwordless login, role-based access, group workspaces (milestones/tasks/discussion), content management, and an admin console.

## Highlights
- Passwordless login via magic link + OTP (JWT session)
- Role-based access: `admin` / `mentor` / `student` / `supervisor`
- Group workspace: milestones, tasks, discussion (with attachments)
- Resources / Events / Announcements with audience visibility controls
- Admin console: stats, user management, exports, group creation

## Quick start (recommended)
```bash
./start_docker.sh
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8000 (API prefix: `/api`)

## Demo mode (frontend only)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
VITE_DEMO_MODE=true npm run dev
```

## Notes
- This release ships with CI (backend tests + frontend lint/test/build) and secret scanning (gitleaks).
- Development `.env` values are examples only; do not reuse demo credentials for production.
